# Meetings Plus

Subscribe to your calendars and create pre-filled meeting notes in one click. No drag-and-drop, no Outlook required.

## What it does

- Subscribe to one or more **ICS calendar feeds** (Outlook, Google, iCloud, Proton, Fastmail — any standards-compliant ICS source)
- Today's meetings appear in a sidebar, sorted by time
- **Multi-day agenda**: flat per-day list with empty days collapsed into a one-line "N days without events" hint. Jump to any future date with the built-in date picker; quick-set how many days to show from the sidebar header
- **Catch up on past meetings**: navigate back up to 30 days (configurable, off by setting 0) and click a past meeting to write up its note after the fact — handy for transposing paper notes
- **One click on a meeting → fully pre-filled meeting note** in your configured folder, with attendees, time, location, agenda — ready to take notes
- **Already prepared?** The sidebar shows which meetings already have notes; clicking opens the existing one
- Optional **pre-meeting notifications** with a configurable lead time
- Optional **daily-note integration** — write today's schedule into your daily note as a managed block
- **Templater-friendly** — if Templater is installed and enabled, your `<% %>` tokens run after Meetings Plus substitutes its own `{{variables}}`
- **Privacy-first**: only network calls are to your calendar URLs, no telemetry, no third-party services
- **Works on mobile**: pure ICS over HTTPS, no native bindings

## Why

The existing **Outlook Meeting Notes** plugin requires Outlook and Obsidian to be open simultaneously, and you drag calendar events between them. That's fragile and slow. Meetings Plus reads your calendar directly via ICS, so Outlook doesn't need to be open and nothing needs to be dragged — your meetings are just there in the sidebar.

## Installation

### From the Obsidian community plugins directory (once approved)

1. Open Obsidian → **Settings → Community plugins**
2. Search for **Meetings Plus**
3. Select **Install**, then **Enable**

### Manual install

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the latest release
2. Copy them into your vault at `.obsidian/plugins/meetings-plus/`
3. Reload Obsidian and enable the plugin under **Settings → Community plugins**

## Getting started

1. Get your calendar's ICS URL (see the next section)
2. Open **Settings → Community plugins → Meetings Plus → Add calendar**
3. Paste the URL, give the calendar a name, optionally pick a color and folder
4. Save — the sidebar opens automatically with today's meetings

## How to get the ICS URL

**Outlook / Microsoft 365**
1. Open Outlook on the web → Calendar
2. Right-click the calendar → **Sharing and permissions** → **Publish a calendar**
3. Set permissions, then copy the ICS link

**Google Calendar**
1. Open Google Calendar → Settings (gear icon) → click the calendar you want under **Settings for my calendars**
2. Scroll to **Integrate calendar**
3. Copy **Secret address in iCal format**

**iCloud**
1. Open Calendar.app → right-click the calendar → **Share Calendar**
2. Enable **Public Calendar** → copy the URL

**Proton Calendar**
1. Open Proton Calendar settings → **Share** → **Public link**
2. Copy the URL

> Meetings Plus also supports HTTP Basic auth: `https://user:pass@host/cal.ics`

## Usage

- Click the **ribbon icon** to open the sidebar, or run **Meetings Plus: Open dashboard**
- **Single click** on a meeting row → create or open the meeting note
- **Right-click** for a context menu: open meeting link, copy link, or hide for today
- **Commands** (via the command palette):
  - Meetings Plus: Open dashboard
  - Meetings Plus: Refresh all calendars
  - Meetings Plus: Create note for next meeting
  - Meetings Plus: Open next meeting link

## Templates

Each calendar has its own editable template. Variables are written as `{{name}}`; date variables accept a moment.js format string after a colon, e.g. `{{start:HH:mm}}`.

| Variable | Output |
|---|---|
| `{{title}}` | Meeting title |
| `{{date}}` | Meeting date in `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `{{start}}`, `{{start:HH:mm}}` | Start datetime |
| `{{end}}`, `{{end:HH:mm}}` | End datetime |
| `{{duration}}` | Duration in minutes |
| `{{location}}` | Location string |
| `{{meeting_url}}` | First detected meeting URL |
| `{{description}}` | Full description, stripped of HTML |
| `{{organizer}}` | Organizer name |
| `{{attendees}}` | Comma-separated attendee names |
| `{{attendees_list}}` | Bulleted list of attendees |
| `{{attendees_wikilinks}}` | Comma-separated `[[Name]]` wikilinks |
| `{{calendar}}` | Calendar display name |
| `{{uid}}` | ICS UID |
| `{{dedup_key}}` | Internal dedup key (used in frontmatter) |
| `{{tags}}` | Calendar's tags as YAML list |

**Templater compatibility**: keep your `<% tp.* %>` tokens in the template. Meetings Plus does its `{{ }}` substitution first; Templater runs second if you enable "Run Templater on new notes".

## Settings

Global options:

- **Refresh interval (minutes)** — how often calendars are fetched in the background
- **Look-ahead window (days)** — how many days of future meetings to load
- **Enable pre-meeting notifications** — show a notice before each meeting starts
- **Notification lead time (minutes)** — how far in advance to notify
- **Run Templater on new notes** — post-process meeting notes through Templater if installed
- **Open dashboard on startup** — auto-open the sidebar when Obsidian loads

Per-calendar options live in the calendar editor and cover URL, color, folder, title pattern, tags, template, and which features (standalone notes, daily-note append, all-day filtering) apply.

## How it works

- Fetches each ICS feed with Obsidian's `requestUrl` (so it works on mobile and bypasses CORS)
- Parses with [ical.js](https://github.com/mozilla-comm/ical.js) — handles timezones, recurrence rules, and the messy real-world ICS variants
- Caches parsed meetings on disk so the sidebar loads instantly on cold start
- Detects Teams / Zoom / Meet / Webex links in the description, location, and Microsoft-specific properties
- Looks up existing meeting notes via the metadata cache (`meeting_dedup_key` in frontmatter) so re-clicking a meeting opens the existing note instead of creating a duplicate

Everything is local and offline except the ICS fetches themselves. There are no third-party services, no analytics, no telemetry.

## Privacy

Meetings Plus only talks to the calendar URLs you configure. It does not collect, log, or transmit calendar contents, attendee names, meeting titles, or fetch URLs anywhere else. There is no analytics layer.

## Performance notes

Background refresh runs at your configured interval (default 15 min); on each refresh, all calendars fetch in parallel. Parsed meetings are cached per calendar so reloads are instant. Pre-meeting `setTimeout`s are cancelled and re-scheduled on every refresh so the schedule stays current.

## Plus Plugin Family

Meetings Plus is part of the **Plus Plugin Family** for Obsidian:

- **[Paste Plus](https://github.com/jabaho9523/obsidian-paste-plus)** — Smart paste: URLs become titled links, images get clean filenames, HTML converts to markdown, YouTube and Twitter links resolve to titles.
- **[Vault Plus](https://github.com/jabaho9523/obsidian-vault-plus)** — Vault health dashboard: find and fix orphans, broken links, empty notes, duplicates, and more.
- **[Link Plus](https://github.com/jabaho9523/obsidian-link-plus)** — Unlinked mention scanner: find and convert unlinked mentions vault-wide with one-click or batch operations.
- **Meetings Plus** — Subscribe to calendars and create pre-filled meeting notes in one click.
